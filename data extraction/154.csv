The communication apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the determination unit further determines whether another device is to perform the monitoring or the communication apparatus is to perform the monitoring when it is notified, from the another device in the first NAN cluster, that the another device is performing the monitoring and the communication apparatus is also performing the monitoring.,8. The communication apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the further determination is made based on values of master ranks of the another device and the communication apparatus according to the NAN standard.,9. The communication apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the determination unit further determines whether another device is to perform the monitoring or the communication apparatus is to perform the monitoring when it is not notified, from the another device in the first NAN cluster, that the another device is performing the monitoring and the communication apparatus is not performing the monitoring.,10. The communication apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the determination unit determines that the communication apparatus is not to perform the monitoring when it is notified, from another device in the first NAN cluster, that the another device is performing the monitoring, and determines that the communication apparatus is to perform the monitoring when it is not notified, from the another device in the first NAN cluster, that the another device is performing the monitoring.,11. The communication apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the communication unit determines that there is a second NAN cluster when, during the second period, a signal to assist other devices to find the second NAN cluster or a signal transmitted during a third period during which a device in the second NAN cluster is able to communicate, is received.,12. A method for a communication apparatus, comprising:performing a transmitting function and a receiving function for a radio signal compliant with the neighbor awareness network (NAN) standard, wherein, while belonging to a first NAN cluster, the communication apparatus activates the transmitting function and the receiving function to perform communication during a first period that is a discovery window (DW) of the first NAN cluster, and deactivates the transmitting function and the receiving function outside of the discovery window;determining whether or not the communication apparatus, among devices in the first NAN cluster, performs monitoring for a presence of a second NAN cluster which is different from the first NAN cluster during a second period which is outside of the first period;controlling the performing of the transmitting function and the receiving function by activating the receiving function and performing the monitoring during the second period when it is determined that the communication apparatus performs the monitoring, and by keeping the transmitting function and the receiving function inactive outside the first period when it is determined that the communication apparatus does not perform the monitoring.,13. A non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that when executed cause a computer to perform a process, the process comprising:performing a transmitting function and a receiving function for a radio signal compliant with the neighbor awareness network (NAN) standard, wherein, while belonging to a first NAN cluster, the communication apparatus activates the transmitting function and the receiving function to perform communication during a first period that is a discovery window (DW) of the first NAN cluster, and deactivates the transmitting function and the receiving function outside of the discovery window;determining whether or not the communication apparatus, among devices in the first NAN cluster, performs monitoring for a presence of a second NAN cluster which is different from the first NAN cluster during a second period which is outside of the first period;controlling the performing of the transmitting function and the receiving function by activating the receiving function and performing the monitoring during the second period when it is determined that the communication apparatus performs the monitoring, and by keeping the transmitting function and the receiving function inactive outside the first period when it is determined that the communication apparatus does not perform the monitoring.]","A communication apparatus includes a transmitting function and a receiving function for a radio signal, and, while belonging to a first group of devices, activates the transmitting and receiving functions to perform communication during a first period, and deactivates the transmitting and receiving functions outside the first period. The communication apparatus determines whether or not it performs monitoring for a presence of a second group of devices during a second period, controls performing of the monitoring by activating the receiving function during the second period when it is determined that the communication apparatus performs such monitoring, and keeping the transmission and receiving functions inactive outside the first period when it is determined that the communication apparatus does not perform such monitoring, and notifies another device in the first group of information related to the second group during the first period when a presence of the second group is detected."
